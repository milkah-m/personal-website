        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p> My name is Milkah Mwangi. I am a young woman who is passionate about learning and growing in my skills.  <br> This passion is what drove me to pursue the software engineeering bootcamp at Moringa. I had never done anything remotely techy before but just slightly over a month in, I can tell that I have really grown in my knowledge. I now have an introductory understanding of:
            <ul>
                <li><b>HTML and CSS</b></li>
                <li><b>JavaScript</b></li>
            </ul> 
             <p> I can't wait to see how much more I will have learned at the end of the bootcamp. When I am not busy trying to figure out all the CSS rules and how JS communicates, you will probably find me listening to an audiobook and/or out and about on a walk.

            <h3>JavaScript Calculator</h3>
           <p class="desc1"><b>Description</b>: I recently created a web-based calculator, using JS fundamentals such as functions, arrays, objects, and loop statements. Then I implemented basic HTML to give it a user interface. This was a great learning experience as I got to put all my learning so far to the test.</p>
